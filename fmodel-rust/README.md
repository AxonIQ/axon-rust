# **f`(`model`)`** - Functional Domain Modeling with Rust

When you’re developing an information system to automate the activities of the business, you are modeling the business.
The abstractions that you design, the behaviors that you implement, and the UI interactions that you build all reflect
the business — together, they constitute the model of the domain.

## `IOR<Library, Inspiration>`

This project can be used as a library, or as an inspiration, or both. It provides just enough tactical Domain-Driven
Design patterns, optimised for Event Sourcing and CQRS.

## Experimental

This project is experimental and is not intended for production use yet.

- It is a playground for ideas and concepts.
- It is a port of [fmodel](https://github.com/fraktalio/fmodel) to Rust.

## Running the application

Cargo is Rust’s build system and package manager. We can use it to run our application:

```shell
cargo run
```
